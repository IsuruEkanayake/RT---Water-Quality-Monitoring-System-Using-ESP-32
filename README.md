# RT---Water-Quality-Monitoring-System-Using-ESP-32
This project is an ESP32-based water quality monitoring system designed for real-time assessment of key water parameters. By integrating pH, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), turbidity, and temperature sensors with the ESP32 microcontroller, the system continuously collects data on the essential aspects of water quality. Each sensor provides specific measurements: the pH sensor evaluates acidity/alkalinity, the TDS sensor monitors dissolved solids, the turbidity sensor gauges water clarity, and the DS18B20 temperature sensor tracks the water's thermal conditions. All measurements are processed using efficient multitasking (FreeRTOS), and results are sent securely to a cloud platform (Firebase) for easy mobile access and remote monitoring. The system supports automated alerts when any parameter deviates from safe ranges, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for drinking water safety, aquaculture, and environmental management applications
